# 🚀 Flutter Starter Kit

Because why start from scratch when you can start with awesomeness? 🎯

A carefully crafted Flutter starter template that save you from the boring setup stuff. You know, the stuff that makes you go "ugh, not again!" 😫

# 🛠 Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (we're rocking version 3.27.1 🎸)
- FVM (Flutter Version Management) - because we're fanc like that
- A cup of coffee ☕️ (or tea 🫖, we don't judge)

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Using FV (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/relief_sphere.git
cd relief_sphere
fvm use 3.27.1
fvm flutter pub get
```

### Without FVM

```bash
# Check your Flutter version
flutter --version

# If not on 3.27.1, upgrad Flutter
flutter upgrade

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/relief_sphere.git
cd relief_sphere
flutter pub get
```

# 🏛 Architecture

This project uses a hybrid architecture combining aspects of MVC and Provider patterns for state management.

### 📱 Application Layers

#### 1. Presentation Layer (`lib/presentation/`)

- **Screens**: UI components and screen logic
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components
- Each screen can have its own widgets folder

#### 2. State Management (`lib/core/notifiers/`)

- **Notifiers**: Provider state management classes
- **States**: Immutable state classes

Example:

```dart
core/notifiers/
├── auth/
│   ├── auth_notifier.dart    # Auth state logic
│   └── auth_state.dart       # Auth state model
└── theme/
    ├── theme_notifier.dart   # Theme state logic
    └── theme_state.dart      # Theme state model
```

#### 3. Data Layer (`lib/core/`)

- **APIs** (`apis/`): API endpoints and network calls
- **Models** (`model/`): Data models and serialization
- **Services** (`services/`): Business logic and services

### 🔄 State Management Flow

```
UI (Screen) → Notifier → State → UI Update
    ↑          ↓
    └── API Services
```

**Flow Details:**

- Screens dispatch actions to Notifiers
- Notifiers handle business logic and update States
- States are immutable and represent UI data
- Services handle external data operations
